# Cushon Interview Task

## Prerequisites

- PHP 8.3 or higher
- Composer
- NVM (Node Version Manager)
- Node.js v22.14.0 (specified in `.nvmrc`)
- PostgreSQL 15.1 (DBngin recommended for easy setup)
- Git

## Installations / Steps to run

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lukepaoloni/cushon-interview-task.git
cd cushon-interview-task
```

### 2. Install backend dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Configure environment

Copy the example environment file and modify it according to your local setup:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

If using DBngin for PostgreSQL, update your `.env` file with these settings:

```
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=cushon
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=
```

Create a new database named `cushon` in DBngin.

### 4. Generate key and run database migrations and seed initial data

```bash
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

### 5. Install frontend dependencies

Use NVM to ensure you're using the correct Node.js version and then install dependencies:

```bash
nvm install
npm ci
```

### 6. Start the development server

Run the development server with npm and PHP server in one command:

```bash
composer run dev
```

The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000

### 7. Running tests

```bash
php artisan test
```

Tests use Laravel's in-memory database by default. No additional database setup is required for running tests.

### API Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/retail/isa/funds` - Retrieve available funds
- `POST /api/retail/isa/investments` - Create a new investment
- `GET /api/retail/isa/investments` - Retrieve investment history

### Demo Credentials

For testing purposes, a demo user is automatically authenticated through the middleware.

### Problem Domain
Cushon is expanding its financial services to include ISA offerings for retail customers who don't have employer relationships with Cushon. This is separate from their existing employer-based ISA and pension offerings.

### Existing Offering
- ISAs and Pensions to Employees of Companies (Employers)

### New Offering
- ISA investments to retail (direct) customers who are not associated with an employer

### Technical Requirements
1. **Fund Selection:**
   - Customers must select a single fund from available options
   - System architecture should anticipate future multi-fund selection capability
2. **Investment Process:**
   - After fund selection, customers specify investment amount
   - System records both fund selection and investment amount
   - Complete investment details must be persistently stored for future queries
3. **System Architecture:**
   - Maintain separation between retail and employer-based systems where practical
   - Implement distinct routing for retail customer flows (e.g. "/retail" prefix)
   - Design data storage model for investment records with query capabilities

### User Flow
1. Customer navigates to the retail ISA fund selection page
2. Customer selects a single fund from available options
3. Customer enters investment amount in the displayed input field
4. Customer confirms by clicking "Deposit" button
5. System confirms successful transaction and stores the investment details
6. Customer can later view their investment history

### Assumptions
- Funds are specific to the ISA selected
- Funds could be offered to both retail and employer-based customers (i.e. not customer type specific)
- Authentication and authorization systems already exist and can be leveraged
- The user interface follows a single-page rather than separate pages for each step
- No additional validation beyond basic investment functionality is required for this phase (such as minimum/maximum investment amount, currency is in GBP, customer has sufficient funds in their account to complete the transition)
- After selecting the fund and providing an amount, the user will also need to click on deposit to record the selection and amount.
- The actual payment processing (transferring funds from the customer's bank account to Cushon) is handled by an existing payment service and is outside the scope of this implementation.

### BDD Scenarios
```gherkin
  Feature: Cushon ISA for retail customers
    As a retail customer
    I want to be able to select a fund within my Cushon ISA and specify an investment amount
    So that I can invest my money according to my preferences

    Scenario: Retrieve available funds
      GIVEN I am an authenticated retail customer
      WHEN I send a GET request to "/api/retail/isa/funds"
      THEN the response status code should be 200
      AND the response should contain a list of available funds including "Cushon Equities Fund"

    Scenario: Create a new investment
      GIVEN I have selected "Cushon Equities Fund" as a fund I'd like to invest in
      WHEN I send a POST request to "/api/retail/isa/investments" with:
      | fund_id    | [fund_id for "Cushon Equities Fund"] |
      | amount     | 25000                                |
      THEN the response status code should be 201
      AND the response should include the investment details
      AND the investment should be stored in the database

    Scenario: Retrieve investment history
      GIVEN I am an authenticated retail customer
      AND I have previously made an investment of "Â£25,000" in "Cushon Equities Fund"
      WHEN I send a GET request to "/api/retail/isa/investments"
      THEN the response status code should be 200
      AND the response should include my investment details
```
